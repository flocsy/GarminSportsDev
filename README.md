# Description

Garmin Sports Dev is for CIQ developers to tinker with the SPORTS and SUB_SPORTS values for saving activities in FIT file.

You can start/stop the activities with the start/stop button or the touch of the screen. Each activity records a short session. Depending on the settings it'll also save it as a FIT file so you'll be able to see it in Garmin Connect.

Using the up/down buttons you can change the "speed" by which it automatically finishes activities and changes to the next one.
